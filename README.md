# FIRST RESPONSE ONLINE

First Response Online is a communication and collaboration platform built to support first responders. It lets police officers, fire fighters, and paramedics share critical data with each other in near real-time. It supports Android, iPad, and PC and integrates with computer aided dispatch and GPS tracking. Units in the field can update their status, complete traffic stops, and even query state & federal databases all without using the radio.
First Response Online has been successful tested at Azure.(By using services like App Service, Azure SQL, CosmosDB & Azure Search, First Response Online can instead focus on empowering first responders instead of maintaining infrastructure.)
